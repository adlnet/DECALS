# <a name="1_0"></a>DECALS
*DECALS, stands for **Data for Enabling Content in Adaptive Learning Systems**. DECALS was a follow-on project to RUSSEL with disparate high-level goals, all of which were achieved during the two-year project*.

**GOAL 1**: Improve search in the LR by adding “semantic search” capabilities.

**GOAL 2**: Enable authorized users to upload their own content to the LR. The LR contains pointers to content and metadata, but not the actual content. DECALS allows users who are interacting with the LR to store content in a persistent repository and make it discoverable in the LR.

**GOAL 3**: Provide content curation services to ADL’s Personal Assistant for Learning (PAL) projects.

**GOAL 4**: Define and implement decals that encode information about learning activities in a way that adaptive learning systems (e.g. PALs) can interpret and use to select or recommend activities.

**GOAL 5**: Evaluate whether adapting search to basic user preferences can improve learning. This addresses the question: “How much adaptation is really needed to increase effect sizes?”

**GOAL 6**: Improve the architecture and feature set of RUSSEL.

## <a name="2_0"></a>Results of the DECALS Project
In achieving the goals stated on the previous page the DECALS team produced the following results:

**RESULT 1**: DECALS Application: The DECALS application turns the LR into a repository that learners and instructors can use to find resources matched to learning goals and preferences and to add additional relevant resources. It serves as a web-based search interface to the LR and provides a means for users to store resources and register them in the LR. DECALS includes RUSSEL’s repository capabilities, innovative search and discovery features, a competency management system, and the ability to produce “decals,” explained below.
  
**RESULT 2**: Evaluation: DECALS search was evaluated for usability and for its applicability as a learning tool. The results of this evaluation, which were positive, are reported separately.

**RESULT 3**: Content Curation: DECALS implements a web service infrastructure that exposes DECALS functionality so that other PALs and adaptive learning systems can use DECALS to manage and curate resources. DECALS includes content management services, meta-tagging services, and competency management services. DECALS is architected to allow third-party services such as machine-learning-based competency alignment services to be added as well.

**RESULT 4**: Competency Management: Most adaptive learning systems maintain information on the competencies (skills, knowledge, and abilities) that individuals have mastered or desire to master. Although not in the original scope of DECALS, it became apparent early in the project that PAL systems must maintain ontologies of competencies and store competency-based learner records. The DECALS team developed a competency management system that meets these requirements. The competency system can be accessed through a user interface or through a set of APIs. It uses information models derived from existing standards and modified by the DECALS team with input from an ADL competency alignment working group.

**RESULT 5**: Decals: DECALS tackled the problem of tagging content with metadata that is not only for human consumption but can also be interpreted by PAL systems and used to select or recommend learning interventions. These tags are called decals. Several possible formats for decals were researched. The format finally used is based on www.schema.org. It uses the JSON-LD representation of existing schema.org elements to represent decals and to associate them with resources and is documented at [http://repo.decals.eduworks.com](http://repo.decals.eduworks.com). 

**RESULT 6**: RUSSEL Updates: To alleviate issues with the original Alfresco-based RUSSEL, the DECALS team re-architected RUSSEL to use a NoSQL database and web service middleware called LEVR™. RUSSEL functionality was then ported from the original RUSSEL implementation, improved for DECALS, and ported back to RUSSEL.

+ Right-click on the decals-ui project and select Google->GWT Compile
+ From the dialog choose the output style of choice and click compile.


### <a name="3_12"></a>Building the LEVR components (levr.war file)

**Some changes need to be made in the original build.xml files:**

+ in build.xml for eduworks-common, change **"eduworks-common-usage"** on top line to **"eduworks-common-jar"**
+ in build.xml for levr-core change **"levr-core-dist"** on top line to **"levr-core-jar"**

The projects: eduworks-common, levr-core and levr-base must be built in the following order:
1. eduworks-common
2. levr-core 
3. levr-base

**To build each project, from the Linux commandline run:**
```
cd ~Development/LEVR/eduworks-common/
sudo ant 
cd ~Development/LEVR/levr-core/
sudo ant 
cd ~Development/LEVR/levr-base/
sudo ant
```

Once each project has been built, copy the file, **levr.war**, from the Development/LEVR/levr-base/dist folder to /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ directory
```
sudo cp levr.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/
```

**NOTE**: After the initial LEVR build and before copying any newly built levr.war file over, it is a good idea to stop the tomcat7 service and remove the old levr.war file and associated levr directory from the /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ directory:
```
sudo service tomcat7 stop (wait to start service again once all projects are setup and configured – see below)
cd /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/
sudo rm –R lev*
```

### <a name="3_13"></a>Installing LEVR scripts

**Create a directory, etc/ under /var/lib/tomcat7/:**
```
sudo mkdir etc/
```

**Copy *.rs2 script files from ~/Source/scripts/base-v2/, ~/Source/scripts/base/, ~/Source/scripts/competency/, and ~/Source/scripts/decals/ to /var/lib/tomcat7/etc directory:**

```
cd ~/Source/scripts/base-v2/
sudo cp * /var/lib/tomcat7/etc/

cd ~/Source/scripts/base/
sudo cp * /var/lib/tomcat7/etc/

cd ~/Source/scripts/competency/
sudo cp * /var/lib/tomcat7/etc/

cd ~/Source/scripts/decals/
sudo cp * /var/lib/tomcat7/etc/
```
**make the owner of etc/ and all sub files and folders tomcat7:**
```
sudo chown –R tomcat7:root etc/
```

### <a name="3_14"></a>Creating a location for the database files

**Create a directory, db/ under /var/lib/tomcat7/:**
```
sudo mkdir db/
```
**make the owner of db/ and all sub files and folders tomcat7:**
```
sudo chown –R tomcat7:root db/
```

### <a name="3_15"></a>Install and configure the decals-ui project

**Create a decals/ directory under webapps/ROOT/:**
```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT/decals/
```
**Copy the contents of the ~/Development/decals-ui/war/ to /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT/decals/:**
```
cd ~/Development/decals-ui/war/
sudo cp –R * /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT/decals/
